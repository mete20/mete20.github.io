career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
     I am a third-year computer engineering student with a passion for technology and a strong desire to succeed.
     My expertise lies in the Java and Python programming languages,
     and I have gained a solid understanding of object-oriented programming principles and software development methodologies through both coursework and personal projects.
     Through my recent internship, I have acquired hands-on experience with Docker for containerization, Docker Compose for multi-container applications,
     MySQL for database management, and FastAPI for building efficient web APIs.
     I've also developed proficiency in implementing database migrations using Alembic, setting up and configuring Python-based web servers,
     and integrating OAuth2 for Google authentication.
     My exposure to these technologies has further honed my skills and deepened my understanding of modern software development practices.
